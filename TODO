- Create testbenches for all modules
- Make a table of all instructions and find out which ones are missing
- Test with simple assembly all implemented instructions
- Improve usage of logic in the ALU (parity bit and sum/sub Cout/VP for example) and Control Unit

- Create a debugger entity to put the debug data that needs to be sent via serial
- Check why serial communication fails sometimes
    -- Probably needs the usage of a protocol with checksum or parity bit at least

- Test operations using 32 bit variables to check the usage of carry in sum/sub

- Stack
- Latch in front of ALU
- Adressings of ROM using romctrl
- 3 addressing modes from ADD type instructions (addr, addr - 3 cycles)
