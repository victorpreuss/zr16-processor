- Need to improve ALU entity to avoid latch creation
- Add comments to control unit instructions and addressing modes
- Test with simple assembly all implemented instructions
- Check why serial communication fails sometimes (offset by 2 the registers and memories)
- Create a debugger entity to put the debug data that needs to be sent via serial
- Create testbenches for all modules (specially control unit and datapath)
- Make a table of all instructions and find out which ones are missing
